    <h3>Home Page: Introduction to Neuroscience and Brain Function</h3>
    <p>The brain is the body's most complex organ. Neurons communicate using both electrical and chemical signals. Genetically determined circuits are the foundation of the nervous system. Life experiences change the nervous system.</p>
    <p>The body is connected to the brain through a complex conglomerate of cells and nerves that transmits data back and forth between the brain, spinal cord, organs, and limbs.
        The brain and spinal cord are considered to be the Central Nervous System (CNS), as they integrate all incoming information from sensors and effectors, and modulate the activity of the body.
        By contrast, the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) comprises somatic and autonomous systems, responsible for voluntary control of skeletal muscles as well as involuntary regulation of bodily functions such as heart rate, digestion, respiration, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal.
